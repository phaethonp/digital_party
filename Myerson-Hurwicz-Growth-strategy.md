# Framework for Structuring the Party Growth Strategy Using the Myerson-Hurwicz Model

The design intention of this framework is to increase the number of people engaging truthfully and meaningfully with the party and reach out to the 50% of citizens not participating in the elections. </br>
### The framework consists of the following modules
* Myerson-Hurwicz  economic models
* Services _Note
We find it more efficient to communicate the services we designed in a personal meeting_
* Code implementation and 
* User interface

### Introduction
To achieve our objective, we introduce services as independent direct mechanisms, progressive profiling, and request only the information that is necessary and related to the status of the users. </br>
We believe that in the age of political fluidity, the goal of the platform **is not to sell memberships in exchange for private personal data**, but to acknowledge that an entity might engage with the party in many different capacities that may or may not include the status of a member.  </br>
### Consequently, the platform must address three distinct purposes:

* Purpose 1: Enable users to engage with the party and reveal their true preferences in policies.

* Purpose 2: Enable users to support the party financially.

* Purpose 3: Help users to become voters.

Some users will form the strong party core and engage in expanding and growing the party


### Increasing participation : We design mechanisms that are optimal for different groups of participants. Why?
> Hurwicz (1972) proved the following negative result: in a standard exchange economy, no incentive-compatible mechanism which satisfies the participation constraint can produce Pareto-optimal outcomes. In other words, private information precludes full efficiency.

## Definitions
**Party Platform**
Party and citizens need a communication system where citizens send messages to the party and where a pre-specified rule assigns an outcome (such as an allocation of goods and services) for every collection of received messages. The communication system is the platform

**Service**
Service: A service is defined as a pair consisting of a message and a rule 


**The Service model**
I model each service as a Hurwicz "direct mechanism"

**The Party model**
The Party is an array of direct mechanisms

**Growth strategy**
The collection of direct mechanisms available on the platform

**KPI's**: Participation metrics
1. The number of citizens participating in the communication system
2.  The growth rate

## The Incentive efficientâ€” Direct mechanism: Each service is modeled as a Direct Mechanism
**The constraints**
1. Incentive Compatibility: The objective is to encourage users to share their true preferences and information willingly 
2. Participation Constraint: Encourage users to participate by creating incentives and ensure that users are not better offf by not participating

3. Pareto Optimality: Resources are used efficiently to benefit all participants.</br>
Example 1: If the party does not understand the political preferences of a user, it cannot design an efficient policy for that group.</br>
Example 2: If the party does not have access to a user's email address, communication becomes inefficient.</br>

## How we use the Multiple Direct Mechanism model to engage users
Because each service is an independent mechanism we create mechanisms that are optimal for different groups of participants. This allows us  to control the components of each service independently without affecting other services or groups


**Step 1**: **Increase participation**
* Objective: Create services that provide value to users. Services will be successful if users are not better off by opting out of participation.
* Identification of Services: Stefanos has provided a solution to this problem. Additionally, the services offered by the party are referenced in the party bylaws.
* Strategy: Target specific groups with clear and tangible benefits.

**Satisfying the participation constraint**
No user should be made worse off by participating in the mechanism which means they will not be in worst condition by reporting their information that is only known to them


### **Step 2: Incentive Compatibility**

**Objective**: Design services so that the most beneficial strategy for each participant is to report their private information truthfully.

**Implementation Strategies**:

   - **Self-Interest Consideration**: Acknowledge that users will disclose private information only if it aligns with their self-interests.

**Minimizing Information Disclosure**:
   - **Selective Information Gathering**: Request only the information that is beneficial to users and necessary for classifying their messages.
   - **Privacy Respect**: Limit the scope of information requested to respect user privacy and reduce the burden of disclosure.

**Self-Interest Driven Design**:
   - **User-Centric Approach**: Focus on users' motivations to ensure that participation and truthful reporting are aligned with their personal benefits.
   - **Optimal Incentives**: Provide incentives that reinforce the value of honest participation, making it the most beneficial choice for users.

Step 3: Pareto Optimality
Objective: We want to ensure that the entire platform allocates resources efficiently to benefit all participants without making anyone worse off, thereby achieving Pareto Optimality across all services and participant groups.
